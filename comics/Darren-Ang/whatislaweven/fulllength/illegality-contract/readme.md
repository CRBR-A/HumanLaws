## Illegality in Contract Law
You and I agree to do an illegal thing. If you shank me, that puts the law in a really weird spot. On one hand, you shouldn't shank me, but on the other, we were going to do an illegal thing. And so we end up in this really weird situation where you can't do anything about the agreement, but it feels unfair.

## Property Rights as "Chains"
I reference an idea by Professor Birks, of property rights being something like a chain. It's a really elegant idea. But to simplify it further, a "property right" is essentially your control over a thing. And if others try to take away your control of the thing, you can hold on tight and tell them to buzz off.

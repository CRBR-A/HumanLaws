A much-more-concise version of an earlier comic on **mortgages**, with most of the technicalities taken away. Basically, I borrow money from you, and if I can't pay you back, you can sell my house. This is a win-win for you in most cases: if I pay, you get the money back with interest, and if I don't, you get a house to sell.

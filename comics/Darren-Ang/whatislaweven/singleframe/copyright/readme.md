**Copyright** is easily the most technical and unusual of the intellectual property (IP) laws. But it's also the one that, if you use the Internet or consume any other creative material at all, we deal with on a day-to-day basis. I struggled quite a lot to squeeze all the concepts I wanted to convey in one frame, so I ended up making an entire video series (in fact, two of them) on copyright alone. Nonetheless, its basic idea is simple: when you create a creative thing, the law turns it into your property.

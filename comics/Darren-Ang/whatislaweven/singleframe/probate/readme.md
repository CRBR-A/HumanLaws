**Probate** only comes into issue when the fellow who died made a will. Basically, ther's suddenly a lot of money lying around for everyone to grab, so the court needs to make sure that it will be given out in accordance with the dead fellow's wishes. If no will is involved, then w're talking about intestate succession.

The **burden of proof** is only important when you want to sue someone in court. In most cases, if you want to get the court to do something, you must prove all the facts which you need for your case. This is only fair; if you didn't need to do that, you could just go around accusing random people of taking your stuff, and they would have to dig up evidence to say that they didn't.

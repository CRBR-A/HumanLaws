The basic idea of a **joint tenancy** is that two people must always act as one unit. If they don't, nothing can ever happen. This involves some special rules, including the "right of survivorship": this means that, if I die, and I'm a joint tenant with you over some stuff, then you get all the stuff in your sole name.

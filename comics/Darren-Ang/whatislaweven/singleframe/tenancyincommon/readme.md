Ther's only two ways to hold stuff. The first is a joint tenancy, and the second is thisâ€”a **tenancy-in-common**.

Joint tenancies are cool until someone dies. At that point, the other owner gets the rest of the stuff. So if you want to share stuff with someone, but you don't want to give them all the stuff when you die, then you and your buddy could try to hold shares in the stuff, as tenants-in-common.
